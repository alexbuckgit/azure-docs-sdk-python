    The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed applications

    be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.

    This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed applications over
    the number

    of nodes where the application is currently deployed on in the cluster.

    The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default

    percentage is zero.'
